Part 1: String Concatenation with +

Create two String variables: one for a person's name, and one for their favorite hobby.

Print a sentence using + string concatenation that says something like:
"Alex enjoys painting in their free time."
You don't have to print this exact sentence, it's just an example.

Part 2: Using printf with multiple types

Create three variables:

a String for a movie name

an int for the release year

a double for the rating (like 8.5)

Use System.out.printf to print a sentence like:
"Inception was released in 2010 and has a rating of 8.5."

Part 1: public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Part 1: String Concatenation with +
        String name = "Teryeyah";
        String hobby = "dancing";
        System.out.println(name + " enjoys " + hobby + " in their free time.");

        // Part 2: Using printf with multiple types
        String movieName = "Inception";
        int releaseYear = 2010;
        double rating = 8.5;
        System.out.printf("%s was released in %d and has a rating of %.1f.%n", movieName, releaseYear, rating);
    }
}
